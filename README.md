This is fiug; formerly known as bartok.
This tool can help you create, run, and manage your code | files | ideas !
```

## get started

If you want an idea of what fiug can do, check out:

- `preview` mode can be chosen in the menu atop the terminal pane.
	- use it when you browse file examples

- `.templates` folder, at the top of the file tree on the left.
	- explore files in this folder to get an idea of how `preview` works

- `examples`, `frontend`, and `playground` folders, to the left in explorer tree.
	- try clicking one of these folders or their child files and watching `preview` pane
	- try clicking the `lock icon` at the top right corner if preview is not updating
	- explore all the files, there's a ton going on!

- `terminal` pane, the right part of the screen.
	- try typing `help` then press `Enter`
	- try one of the `commands` listed, not everything works but some do

- `service map` screen, appears after clicking the triangular icon near top, far left .
	- check out connected services and the connections within services
	- drag the nodes around to `position` them
	- drag a blank area of the screen to `pan` around
	- zoom in and out with `+/-`

Feel free to edit anything or create your own files and folders. You won't hurt anything!
