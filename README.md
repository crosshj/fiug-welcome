# welcome!
This is fiug (formerly known as bartok), a system that is being created to help you create, run, and manage your code!

With fiug, your code is collected into collections of files called services.

If you want an idea of what fiug can do, check out:

	- `preview` mode can be chosen in the menu atop the terminal pane.
	Use it when you browse file examples.  This is one of the primary features of fiug.

	- `.templates` folder, at the top of the file tree on the left.
	Exploring files in this folder will give you an idea of how `preview` works

	- `examples`, `frontend`, and `playground` folders, to the left in explorer tree.
	Try clicking one of these folders or their child files and watching `preview` pane.  If the preview is not changing, try clicking the lock icon at the top right corner.

	- `terminal` pane, the right part of the screen.
	Try entering `help` then press `Enter` - not everything works, but some things do!!

	- `service map` screen, appears after clicking the triangular icon near top, far left .
	This shows connected services and connections within services.

Feel free to edit anything or create your own files and folders.

In fiug's current state, you won't hurt anything!

## more info

Check out the [bartok developer video log at youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzxw4c2I_GGe6q7XHWH2lXsc9VBfzsNB_).
You can use this to keep up with fiug as it is being improved.

## primary purposes

dig in to any file
	- change on a binary level
	- crop, resize, copy/paste, label, (+more) for images
	- convert between file formats
	- zip files up

rationalize about complicated connections and situations
	- code golf
	- connections between microservices

create visually and textually with ease
	- preview just about any kind of file
	- add a template that lets you make your own preview

share using novel methods
	- beam your file or project to another fiug user
	- create a slideshow and videocast it

understand and track changes
	- git and github are the model for this
	- let's do it in an editor in your browser
	- let's improve on it
