neural cellular automata:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kec_7WFyp0

saw videos on the following, maybe bookmarked them, having trouble finding now
- fruit fly embryo (similar to this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ZlvCINozs)
- planrian-like similation of growth and regrowth of body parts

what I'd like to explore:
- even very basic cellular automata from traditional perspective
- newer cellular automata techniques
- basic image creation/re-creation as seen above with neural nets + CA
- webgl + all of this
