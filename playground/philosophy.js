an exploration of philosophy, inspired after watching:
The Darkest Philosopher in History - Arthur Schopenhauer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpMkXyBWpl8

Parts of a Unified System of Philosophy:
- metaphysics
- epistemology
- ethics
- aesthetics
- value judgements
- ... and so forth

Kant -> Schopenhauer -> Nietsche

thoughts:
- analyze unverifiable/debatable  claims not just on their content, but also what memetic/viral appeal they have (or by other criteria)
- incompleteness (and similar) may be the closest humanity has come to identifying existential problems without making extraneous claims
